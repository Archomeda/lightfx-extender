# LightFX Extender
This plugin allows gamers to take advantage of LightFX (or AlienFX) features in
order to extend it to other hardware such as Logitech keyboards and Lightpack
devices. It also adds some small extra features for specific games that have one
or more extra APIs.

## Hardware support
- Logitech keyboards and mice with LEDs through Logitech Gaming Software
8.57.145 or higher
- Lightpack devices through a recent version of Prismatik (or similar hardware
and software that support the same API)

## Extended support for games
- Guild Wars 2 through the officially supported Mumble Link API (change color
based on your PvP/WvW team upon entering map or switching PvP teams)

## Contribute
If you want to contribute to the project, make a fork, change stuff and do a
pull request. Submitting issues is also welcome.

Example contributions that come to mind are:
- Extending support to more hardware
- Extending support for games that have (an) extra API(s) at their disposal
(like Guild Wars 2)
- Bugfixes if you encounter a bug
